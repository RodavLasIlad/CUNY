Adding the contents of two numeric vectors using a for loop:

```{r}
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
vec2 <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
sumVec <- c(0,0,0,0,0)
for (i in 1:length(vec1)){
  sumVec[i] <- vec1[i] + vec2[i]
}
(sumVec)
```
The vectorized approach is much easier and efficient:
```{r}
sumVec2 <- vec1 + vec2
(sumVec2)
```

While loop detecting heads:
```{r}
coinFlips <- c("heads","heads", "tails","heads")
i <- 1
while(coinFlips[i] == "heads"){
  i = i+1
}
(i-1)
```

for loop from 1 to 100 adding only the odds (it feels really wrong to write it this way):
```{r}
runningSum <- 0
for (i in 1:100){
  if (!(i %% 2 == 0)){
    runningSum = runningSum + i
  }
}
(runningSum)
```
and an infinitely simpler solution (not using a loop):
```{r}
(sum(seq(1,100,2)))
```
